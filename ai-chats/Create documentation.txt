I have a Spring - Maven project with such files: Player PlayerAnalyzer Student StudentConverter and corresponding test files: PlayerAnalyzerTest StudentConverterTest I can give you names of every test that I have: testConvertStudents_ExceptionalCase testConvertStudents_HonorRollCase testConvertStudents_PassedCase testConvertStudents_NotPassedCase testConvertStudents_EmptyList testConvertStudents_NullInput testCalculateScore_SinglePlayer testCalculateScore_SinglePlayer testCalculateScore_SinglePlayer_Age25 testCalculateScore_SinglePlayer_Age15 testCalculateScore_SinglePlayer_Age35 testCalculateScore_MultiplePlayers testCalculateScore_NullSkills_ShouldThrowError testCalculateScore_EmptyArray_ShouldReturnZero I need to Update Readme.md with : Junit Test description: 2 paragraphs, 4-10 Sentences. Information on how to run tests locally.

JUnit Test Description
The test suite for this Spring-Maven project is designed to comprehensively assess the functionality and robustness of the StudentConverter and PlayerAnalyzer classes. For the StudentConverter class, the tests cover various scenarios that one might encounter when converting Student objects. For example, the testConvertStudents_ExceptionalCase test deals with edge cases, while testConvertStudents_HonorRollCase checks whether students qualifying for the honor roll are processed correctly. Other tests like testConvertStudents_PassedCase, testConvertStudents_NotPassedCase, testConvertStudents_EmptyList, and testConvertStudents_NullInput ensure that the class works as expected for students in different academic statuses and for various edge cases such as empty lists or null inputs.
Similarly, the PlayerAnalyzer class is rigorously tested to calculate the scores of Player objects based on varying conditions. For instance, testCalculateScore_SinglePlayer checks the score calculation for a single player while tests such as testCalculateScore_SinglePlayer_Age25, testCalculateScore_SinglePlayer_Age15, and testCalculateScore_SinglePlayer_Age35 verify that the age-based logic in score calculations works correctly. More complex scenarios like handling multiple players (testCalculateScore_MultiplePlayers) or encountering null or empty skill sets (testCalculateScore_NullSkills_ShouldThrowError, testCalculateScore_EmptyArray_ShouldReturnZero) are also tested to ensure the method's robustness.
Running Tests Locally
To run these JUnit tests locally on your machine, follow these steps:
Prerequisite: Make sure you have Maven and Java installed on your system. If not, you can install them from their respective official websites.
Clone the Repository: If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>


Navigate to the Project Directory: Use the terminal to navigate to the root directory of the cloned project.
bash
Copy code
cd <project_directory>


Run the Tests: Execute the following Maven command to run all the JUnit tests.
bash
Copy code
mvn test
This command compiles the project and runs all the JUnit tests defined in your test classes. Maven will automatically download any required dependencies.
Review Test Results: After running the tests, you will see output in the terminal indicating whether the tests passed or failed. Detailed logs can also be found in the target/surefire-reports directory within your project folder.
By following these steps, you can easily run the JUnit tests for this Spring-Maven project on your local machine.

Nice text, could you add html tags (like <h1><\h1>, <b></b>, etc) so text will be properly formated for readme.md?

Certainly! While Markdown (.md) files usually use their own markup language, it's worth noting that many Markdown renderers also support HTML tags for formatting. Below is the text with HTML tags added for better formatting.
